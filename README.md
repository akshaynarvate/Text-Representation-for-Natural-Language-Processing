# Distributed Text Representation:
Distributed text representation is when the representation of a word is not independent or mutually exclusive of another word and their configurations often represent various metrics & concepts in data. So the information about a word is distributed along the vector it is represented as. This is different from discrete representation where each word is considered unique & independent of each others.

Some of the commonly used distributed text representations are:

Co-Occurrence matrix
Word2Vec
GloVe
